                        When the historic Pearl Gate welcomes the new students inside the
                        campus of the oldest technical institute in Asia, there is
                        anticipation, excitement and joy in the air. The students, even after
                        having done an extensive amount of research, are in awe of what all
                        the institute has to offer, and the groups and clubs of IIT Roorkee
                        are ready with open arms to welcome their new members. Among
                        these groups is the 3UK CTR National Cadet Corps, one of the most
                        decorated and respected groups of the campus. Known for its
                        regular and active participation in numerous programmes of
                        national importance, the NCC of IIT Roorkee is one of its kind,
                        providing students with an opportunity to better themselves in
                        myriad ways, inculcating in them the values of discipline, unity,
                        teamwork and patriotism and inciting in them an insatiable hunger
                        to do something for the country, to make our nation proud; these
                        are the values and thoughts which leave an impact, strong and
                        lifelong, on the personality of the cadets.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The NCC IIT Roorkee celebrates Independence and Republic days
                        with an impressive Guard of Honour to the Director of the institute.
                        Against a background of the venerated James Thomason building
                        and the lush green grounds in front of it, the cadets, properly
                        dressed and groomed, with weapons in their hands and glow of
                        pride in their eyes, are the jewels of the celebration of National
                        Festivals. What is behind this auspicious show is an enormous
                        amount of discipline in the cadets, and a persistent effort to become
                        better, better at everything that they do. During the practice
                        marches, not everyone is equally comfortable with holding the rifle
                        and parading, but they hold on and try to do the things as perfectly
                        as possible. Not everyone is on time for the practice in the
                        beginning but with time, the cadets become more serious about
                        their punctuality. This is the first thing that the NCC teaches its
                        cadets, the importance of time and punctuality; the spirit of unity
                        and the value of discipline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During their course of stay in the campus, the cadets attend the
                        lectures taken by the ANOs who involve the cadets intellectually
                        and provide them with the necessary mental inputs required for
                        personality development and building of a great character. The
                        classes and march sessions at the 3 UK CTR NCC unit held weekly
                        help with the physical development and involvement of the cadets
                        and this habit helps, after two or three years of JEE preparation, in
                        developing a healthy lifestyle and a good, disciplined life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 3 UK CTR NCC organizes many events in the campus too and
                        has a substantial campus presence. Cleanliness and tree-plantation
                        drives are organized regularly to make people aware about the
                        environment and the problems it is facing. The cadets also get an
                        opportunity to interact with a huge number of people from different
                        backgrounds during these drives leading to the development of
                        communication skills in them. Treasure hunts are held every year,
                        with a good number of people participating in them to make the
                        hunts successful. The NCC IIT Roorkee also holds sports meets and
                        competitions having both indoor and outdoor sports, which witness
                        huge popularity among students, and they develop the values of
                        unity and team-spirit. The cadets also have chance to get into the
                        core team of the NCC and it leads to development of several skills in
                        the cadets, be it writing ability, or creative designing or organizing
                        abilities, the cadets get the opportunity to develop them leading to
                        their betterment at a personal level, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The NCC is nothing without its physical activities. The 3 UK CTR
                        NCC holds treks for its cadets to various places, embellished with
                        the beauty of mother nature and in the heart of the Himalayas,
                        where the cadets get the opportunity to witness nature in its raw
                        form and get a break from the routine life in tranquility and
                        enchantment of nature. Firing events are also organized by the NCC
                        to give the cadets a firsthand experience at the act of shooting,
                        which acts as a basic military training should the need ever arise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The NCC IIT Roorkee also provides its cadets with a preliminary
                        knowledge about the Indian army, its hierarchy and proud history.
                        The values of patriotism and love for oneâ€™s nation is invoked in the
                        cadets upon learning about the supreme sacrifices made by our
                        brave-hearts
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would not be an exaggeration to say that the 3 UK CTR NCC
                        leaves a lifelong impression upon the students which are or have
                        been a part of it. The values of humility, team-work, patriotism,
                        discipline, unity, collectiveness and many more, learnt from the
                        NCC, are retained in the individual even after leaving the campus,
                        but they guide one in every walk of life, they show way whenever
                        one is stuck somewhere and these are the values which lead the
                        person to groom a character, determined as a mountain, taller than
                        most of the people around and having compassion and empathy for
                        everyone. This is the mark which the NCC leaves, this is the mark
                        of Humanity.
