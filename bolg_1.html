When the historic Pearl Gate welcomes the new students inside the
campus of the oldest technical institute in Asia, there is
anticipation, excitement and joy in the air. The students, even after
having done an extensive amount of research, are in awe of what all
the institute has to offer, and the groups and clubs of IIT Roorkee
are ready with open arms to welcome their new members. Among
these groups is the 3UK CTR National Cadet Corps, one of the most
decorated and respected groups of the campus. Known for its
regular and active participation in numerous programmes of
national importance, the NCC of IIT Roorkee is one of its kind,
providing students with an opportunity to better themselves in
myriad ways, inculcating in them the values of discipline, unity,
teamwork and patriotism and inciting in them an insatiable hunger
to do something for the country, to make our nation proud; these
are the values and thoughts which leave an impact, strong and
lifelong, on the personality of the cadets.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The NCC IIT Roorkee celebrates Independence and Republic days
with an impressive Guard of Honour to the Director of the institute.
Against a background of the venerated James Thomason building
and the lush green grounds in front of it, the cadets, properly
dressed and groomed, with weapons in their hands and glow of
pride in their eyes, are the jewels of the celebration of National
Festivals. What is behind this auspicious show is an enormous
amount of discipline in the cadets, and a persistent effort to become
better, better at everything that they do. During the practice
marches, not everyone is equally comfortable with holding the rifle
and parading, but they hold on and try to do the things as perfectly
as possible. Not everyone is on time for the practice in the
beginning but with time, the cadets become more serious about
their punctuality. This is the first thing that the NCC teaches its
cadets, the importance of time and punctuality; the spirit of unity
and the value of discipline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During their course of stay in the campus, the cadets attend the
lectures taken by the ANOs who involve the cadets intellectually
and provide them with the necessary mental inputs required for
personality development and building of a great character. The
classes and march sessions at the 3 UK CTR NCC unit held weekly
help with the physical development and involvement of the cadets
and this habit helps, after two or three years of JEE preparation, in
developing a healthy lifestyle and a good, disciplined life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 3 UK CTR NCC organizes many events in the campus too and
has a substantial campus presence. Cleanliness and tree-plantation
drives are organized regularly to make people aware about the
environment and the problems it is facing. The cadets also get an
opportunity to interact with a huge number of people from different
backgrounds during these drives leading to the development of
communication skills in them. Treasure hunts are held every year,
with a good number of people participating in them to make the
hunts successful. The NCC IIT Roorkee also holds sports meets and
competitions having both indoor and outdoor sports, which witness
huge popularity among students, and they develop the values of
unity and team-spirit. The cadets also have chance to get into the
core team of the NCC and it leads to development of several skills in
the cadets, be it writing ability, or creative designing or organizing
abilities, the cadets get the opportunity to develop them leading to
their betterment at a personal level, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The NCC is nothing without its physical activities. The 3 UK CTR
NCC holds treks for its cadets to various places, embellished with
the beauty of mother nature and in the heart of the Himalayas,
where the cadets get the opportunity to witness nature in its raw
form and get a break from the routine life in tranquility and
enchantment of nature. Firing events are also organized by the NCC
to give the cadets a firsthand experience at the act of shooting,
which acts as a basic military training should the need ever arise. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The NCC IIT Roorkee also provides its cadets with a preliminary
knowledge about the Indian army, its hierarchy and proud history.
The values of patriotism and love for oneâ€™s nation is invoked in the 
cadets upon learning about the supreme sacrifices made by our
brave-hearts
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would not be an exaggeration to say that the 3 UK CTR NCC
leaves a lifelong impression upon the students which are or have
been a part of it. The values of humility, team-work, patriotism,
discipline, unity, collectiveness and many more, learnt from the
NCC, are retained in the individual even after leaving the campus,
but they guide one in every walk of life, they show way whenever
one is stuck somewhere and these are the values which lead the
person to groom a character, determined as a mountain, taller than
most of the people around and having compassion and empathy for
everyone. This is the mark which the NCC leaves, this is the mark
of Humanity.
